# Local-Patterns-Generalize-Better-for-Novel-Anomalies

For better debugging, the code is divided into four parts: Detection, Backbone feature extraction, Identifying language-informative local pattern, and State-machine module

# Detection 
Input videos are placed according to the format: input_data\ 
We have utilized RPN (https://github.com/microsoft/RegionCLIP) for locating bounding boxes, the boxes are organized according to the format:  
detection_results\test  
detection_results\train 

# Backbone 
We have provided the backbone for feature extraction at backbone\ 
The process: backbone\resnet_featuremap_as_backbone.py 
The features are saved at: backbone\heatmaps_resnet 

# Identifying language-informative local pattern
prepare_anno.py organizes the results in backbone\heatmaps_resnet for Image-attention Module   
The backbone features corresponding to train set are stored at resnet_caption.json with only normal behaviors  
The backbone features corresponding to test set are stored at resnet_caption_test.json with abnormal behaviors    
Then run Image-attention Module with inference_Image-attention-Module.py   
Note that the pretrained weights for Image-attention Module are at: pretrained folder    
Saved results:    
The outputs for test set: Image_Module_output_features_test folder   
The outputs for training set: Image_Module_output_features_train folder   

# State Machine Module 
Leverage the results in Image_Module_output_features_test and Image_Module_output_features_train to feed into State Machine Module    
Note that the temporal associations between bounding boxes are addressed in folder detection_results where each item in json file has a key of "idx" denoting identity     
Folder State-Machine-Module:     
Train on normal data: train_statespace.py --smooth_or_predwithsmoothed_or_predwithunsmoothed train --num_transform 2    
checkpoints are saved at data/exp_dir_state     
Test on abnormal data:   
revise checkpoint dir and run    
train_statespace.py --smooth_or_predwithsmoothed_or_predwithunsmoothed predwithunsmoothed --num_transform 2
